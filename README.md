# docs
This folder contains scientific articles, my master’s thesis, and other relevant documents.
- [Daniel_Master_Thesis.pdf](docs/Daniel_Master_Thesis.pdf)
*This is my Master's Thesis presented in 2018 at the Univeristy of Aveiro.* 
  - Daniel_PhD_Paper1.pdf - This paper is my literature review conducted during my PhD in which I identify some of the research gaps to which my PhD thesis will contribute
  - Daniel_PhD_Paper2.pdf - This paper reports the results obtained from a set of experimental tests on prototypes of Domestic Chest Freezers with and without PCMs for energy Storage. 
    The work was mainly conducted by Dr. Vitor Silva and his team at TENSAI Indústria SA, while I have contributed with post-data treatment and analysis and with the whole paper writing process.
# src > In this folder you can find mostly source code files from the work I have conducted with TRNSYS, which included coding in FORTRAN
  - Type936.f90 - this is the original source code available in the library when one holds a license to run the SOFTWARE - it emulates the behaviour of domestic refrigeration systems
  - Type936VF.f90 - this source code consists of
