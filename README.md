# Portfolio

Hello, my name is **Daniel Marques**, I hold a **Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering (2018)** and I am currently concluding my **PhD in the same field** at the University of Aveiro.

This repository contains selected work from my academic and early professional journey, including **scientific documents** and **source code** related to thermodynamics, renewable energy, and energy storage in PCMs.

## ðŸ“‚ docs
This folder contains scientific articles, my masterâ€™s thesis, and other relevant documents.
- [Daniel_Master_Thesis.pdf](docs/Daniel_Master_Thesis.pdf)
*This is my Master's Thesis presented in 2018 at the Univeristy of Aveiro.* 
- [Daniel_PhD_Paper1.pdf](docs/Daniel_PhD_Paper1.pdf)
*Literature review conducted during my PhD, identifying key research gaps to which my thesis contributes and the methodological approach to adopt*
- [Daniel_PhD_Paper2.pdf](docs/Daniel_PhD_Paper2.pdf)
*Paper reporting results from experimental tests on domestic chest freezers with and without PCM for energy storage. Experimental work led by Dr. Vitor Silva and the team at TENSAI IndÃºstria SA. My contribution: post-processing of experimental data, results' analysis and discusion and full paper writing.*

## ðŸ“‚ src
This contains mostly source code files related to my work with **TRNSYS** and **Fortran**, programming.
- [Type936.f90](src/Type936.f90)
*Original source code available in the TRNSYS library (licenseds software)
It emulates the behaviour of domestic refrigeration systems.*
- [Type936VF.f90](src/Type936VF.f90)
*Modified version of Type936, developed to enable deeper parametric studies, including PCM modelling and new smart control strategies.*
- [Type59_PCM_FDM.f90](src/Type59_PCM_FDM.f90)
*Novel TRNSYS model developed to simulate the heat transfer in PCM slabs considering 1D conduction with the Finite Difference Method and the intrinsic approach*
