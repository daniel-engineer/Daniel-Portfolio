# src > In this folder you can find mostly source code files from the work I have conducted with TRNSYS, which included coding in FORTRAN
  - Type936.f90 - this is the original source code available in the library when one holds a license to run the SOFTWARE - it emulates the behaviour of domestic refrigeration systems
  - Type936VF.f90 - this source code consists of
